	<h2>My name is Trevor Lane. You can call me Trevor or Trev.</h2>
	<h4>My major is Computer Science and I'm in my third year of study.</h4>
	<h4>On a scale of one to ten, I'm a five in my web development confidence.</h4>
	<h4>I hope to learn more about integrating databases into web projects.</h4>
	<h4>Have I signed up for Piazza? Yes!</h4>
	<h4>An interesting fact about myself:</h4>
	<p>I've been involved in music for almost as long as I can remember. 
	I began learning how to play piano in third grade, and continued taking lessons for five years. In addition, I love to play guitar, which is where my passion truly lies. 
	One of the most fun parts of playing (electric) guitar is collecting effects pedals
	to craft and create new and unique sounds.</p>
