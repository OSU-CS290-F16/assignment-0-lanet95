	<h1>First Assignment! -- Monday, September 26th</h1>
	<p>I've (basically) finished my first assignment for CS290! Feels pretty good. Reflecting on it, I did run into a few issues that I had to work through. For example, upon uploading my picture to my webpage, I discovered that it was displaying upside-down! After a few quick Google searches, I found an answer to my issue on Stack Exchange. It turns out that Samsung phones encode photos with information about the "proper" orientation. All I had to do was open the photo in Paint and save it again. </p>
